# Surf's Up


## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to gather additional info for W.Avy on temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii in order to assess if opening a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round.

## Results

The results for June are shown in the table below:

In the data we can see that the average temperature for June is ~75°F with a minimum of 64°F and a maximum of 85°F through the given timeframe.

The results for December are show in the table below:

Looking at December, we can see that the average temperature is ~71°F with a minimum of 56°F and a maximum of 83°F through the given timeframe.

Some key differences between the months of June and December are:
- The average temperature varies ~4°F between the two months, but the average minimum temperatures are separated 8°F.
- June's temperature is 75°F+ for the bulk of the month while December's temperature roughly stays below 75°F for the majority of the month.
- June's minimum temperature of 64°F is quite a bit warmer versus Decembers at 56°F.

## Summary

From our analysis of the temperatures in June and December we can see that there are key differences between the two months. June is naturally warmer than December on average and has a much higher minimum temperature over the time frame provided in the data. However, most of the differences are small enough that it could mean having enough business in December to justify opening a surf and ice cream shop year-round. In order to be more certain about that decision we would want to run more analysis with more data to get a better overall view of the total situation. Some analysis I would like to run would be the amount increase/decrease of tourist visiting the island through the year, specifically June and December. As well as extracting data on food trends in those months to better justify ice cream in last quarter of the year.
